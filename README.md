Made changes to App.js to add mesh as part of a group in THREE.Group(). The advantage of using THREE.Group is that it allows you to manipulate the entire group as a single entity. You can apply transformations (such as position, rotation, and scale) to the group, and those transformations will be applied to all its child objects. It provides a convenient way to organize and manipulate multiple objects collectively.
